                  <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4">He looked on the popcorn package first to make sure there were any instructions. He opened the microwave and laid the package of popcorn inside the microwave. Instead of setting a time for the microwave, he looked at the interface and found a specialized function for popcorn so he clicked the popcorn button on the microwave and waited for it to beep because it was done. Then he pressed the fat button at the bottom and took out his popcorn. He seemed surprised to find the popcorn button on the microwave at first and pondered as to whether he should use it or not.</p>

                    <br>She filled up a ramen container with water and already knew the amount of time she needed to use the microwave. So she then set the timer to 2 minutes 30 seconds using the number pads. Clicked start and waited for the final beep. She was very efficient in how she used the microwave from start to finish.<br>

                    <br>He had a pretty interesting relaxed approach to the interface. Instead of using a more measured approach like the other two, he set the timer to around 8 minutes which was more than he would use and then sat next to the microwave waiting for visual indications of the food being ready. In this particular case, he cooked hot dogs and looked through the microwave screen until the hot dogs burst, giving him an indication of readiness.<br>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-14">1: making hot dogs, sausages, easy mac, heating up leftovers.<br>2: probably for ever, my whole life since I was like 5 so like 15 years.<br>3: I usually just turn the numbers on for a timer and leave it go, my microwave back home didn’t have any of the fancy features.<br>4: Depends, I usually set it and just wait for the food to be done. I check on it to make sure it’s ready.<br>5: It does, but I never really set a specific time, I just kinda like leave it on for a while and see when it’s done because it doesn’t always work the same and sometimes it needs more time or less so I just sit and watch it.<br>6: Yeah it’s pretty easy, easier than cooking that’s for sure.<br>

                      <p class="u-text u-text-2">The use is First Grade Freddie, and he walks home from school to find that sometimes his parents haven't come home from work yet. He's usually hungry after school because his recess is at the end of the day and he eats the food his parents leave him when they have time to cook before the workday. Some of the interface problems Freddie observes is being afraid of creating a dangerous situation while he's by himself. Freddi also has initial trouble deciding what to click so that the microwave heats up his food.<br>
                        <br>This persona represents users of the microwave because the microwave was meant to make things easy for people who might misuse the kitchen stove or are afraid of working with fire. Freddie is a clear example of someone who needs a simple solution to heating up food without running any risks of working with fire without experience.

                      <p class="u-text u-text-2">The user is Busy Busy Bethanie, and she usually has meetings or classes throught the day that keep her on a very tight schedule. Bethanie sometimes has too much work and has no time to cook or doesn't realize she won't be back home for&nbsp; while after she heads out to campus, so she needs food that she can mindlessly prepare in a timely fashion. For Bethanie, her problems involve having to get ready while the food is cooking so she needs to pay minimal attention and she also needs to get her food as quickly as possible. Within the interface this means she needs to be able to leave it alone and it will keep working and there needs to be close to 0 prep time.<br>
                        <br>This persona represents users of the microwave bcause the microwave was meant to fast-track the process for heating up food. Because it works very efficiently with different strength settings (high energy heats up quicker), and it's hard to burn things because the technology the microwaves use for actually heating up food (causing moisture to produce heat by stimulating the water molecules), Bethanie ends up being an ideal user who can't pay attention to the food they're making and needs it to heat up fast.
